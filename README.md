First of all  
What is Arkanoid?  
It's award-winning game with bunch of ports.   
What is Space Invaders?  
It's a game with was sold on hudrends thousend arcades.  

Have you ever wanted to mix those two games?  
I don't know.  
Propably you have 'cause you're still there...  
I didn't but I managed to do it anyway.  

Here is gif from early state of development as a proof:

You may wonder why it has "pong" in name if it's a mix of Arkanoid and Space Invaders  
I don't know   
I guess it just sounds COOL
